I will not answer questions about Change HTTP Request Header the Chrome extension or update it anymore.<br><br><!--more--><br><br>Well, I'm still receving user mails asking various and freaky questions about CHRH(Change HTTP Request Header the Chrome extension). It's sold at a 坑(low?) price. The procedure in bank is really unforgettable, I do (not) enjoy the 坑 exchange rate, haha. Anyhow, I've transferred the possession of the extension, including the store item and the source codes, to someone I never know. It was mine but it's not now. Please stop sending mails asking questions. No more service here.<br><br>好吧，我把“修改HTTP请求头”这个奇妙的 Chrome 扩展以奇妙的坑价格卖出去了，此外还体验了一把奇妙而又磨叽的银行故事和建行低得离谱的汇率。总之现在我已经把这个扩展在 Chrome 应用商店的权限和源代码都转出去了，有问题出门右转，我这里不提供服务了~
